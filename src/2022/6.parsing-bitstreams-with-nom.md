Programming languages generally only manipulate bytes (groups of 8 bits). It can be pretty tricky to manipulate single bits. But sometimes you need to -- for example, a [DNS header](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-4.1.1) has some 4-bit numbers, and encodes some boolean flags into single bits. So we really need a way to parse binary data without chunking it up into bytes of 8 bits.

Luckily, [Nom](https://docs.rs/nom) can do this! In the last blog post, we learned how to [parse text files](https://blog.adamchalmers.com/nom-chars) with Nom. The trick is to start with simple parsers that parse a few characters at a time. Then, using combinators, combine those simple parsers into more complex parsers that can deserialize an entire structured file. We can reuse this approach for parsing binary data too. Let's see how!

Note that all code examples use Nom 7 -- I'll try to update this if Nom 8 makes breaking changes, but I can't guarantee anything :)
