酷熊：第 10 天，第 10 天，第 10 天！

好吧，到[第 10 天](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/10)了。

同样，问题描述看起来令人困惑 —— 但问题本来就是如此。有一串数字:

```text
16
10
15
5
1
11
7
19
6
12
4
```

我们需要向其中加入 0，并且不管最大值是多少，最大值加 3:

```text
16
10
15
5
1
11
7
19
6
12
4
0
22
```

至此，如果我们按顺序取它们，会发现它们之间间隔为 1，或者间隔为 3：

```text
0
1 // 1
4 // 3
5 // 1
6 // 1
7 // 1
10 // 3
11 // 1
12 // 1
15 // 3
16 // 1
19 // 3
22 // 3
```

我们需要把间隔为 1 的数乘以我们找到的间隔为 3 的数。

我们可以使用一些我们最近看到的技术: 使用一些类型来表示结果，使用切片上的 `windows` 来处理连续的项，以及一些其他新技巧:

```rust
#[derive(Default, Clone, Copy, Debug)]
struct Results {
    ones: usize,
    threes: usize,
}

fn main() {
    let mut numbers: Vec<_> = std::iter::once(0)
        .chain(
            include_str!("input.txt")
                .lines()
                .map(|x| x.parse::<usize>().unwrap()),
        )
        .collect();
    // clippy told me to use `sort_unstable`
    numbers.sort_unstable();

    if let Some(&max) = numbers.iter().max() {
        // numbers is still sorted after this
        numbers.push(max + 3);
    }

    let results = numbers.windows(2).fold(Results::default(), |acc, s| {
        if let [x, y] = s {
            match y - x {
                1 => Results {
                    ones: acc.ones + 1,
                    ..acc
                },
                3 => Results {
                    threes: acc.threes + 1,
                    ..acc
                },
                gap => panic!("invalid input (found {} gap)", gap),
            }
        } else {
            unreachable!()
        }
    });
    dbg!(results, results.ones * results.threes);
}
```

>* 酷熊热辣小贴士
> 注意，如果我们使用 nightly Rust，我们可以使用 `array_windows`，它给我们提供一个 `[usize; 2]` ，然后我们不需要 `if let`，这是一个非常适合的模式！

```shell
$ cargo run --quiet
[src/main.rs:40] results = Results {
    ones: 7,
    threes: 5,
}
[src/main.rs:40] results.ones * results.threes = 35
```

让我们试试真正的输入:

```shell
$ cargo run --quiet
[src/main.rs:40] results = Results {
    ones: 75,
    threes: 37,
}
[src/main.rs:40] results.ones * results.threes = 2775
```

第一部分已经完成了！

## 第二部分

下一个问题是: 连接适配器的所有可能方式是哪些？它们都是有效的链条吗？

假设我们有:

```text
1
2
3
5
6
```

我们可以有 `[1,2,3,5,6]` ，`[1,2,3,6]` ，`[1,2,5,6]` ，`[1,3,5,6]` ，或 `[1,3,6]`。

类似于[第 7 天](https://fasterthanli.me/series/advent-of-code-2020/part-7)中的 DAG，这里也可视为一个 DAG：

![](https://fasterthanli.me/content/series/advent-of-code-2020/part-10/assets/dag.0ae5df3941452e46.svg)

但是，与第 7 天不同，我们对遍历子图的所有节点不感兴趣，我们感兴趣的是遍历该图的所有不同方式！

但是我们对这些路径到底是什么并不感兴趣，我们感兴趣的是有多少条路径存在 —— 所以我认为这次我们可以聪明一点。把它作为一种享受。

思考最后一个节点，`6` —— 只有一种方法可以从那里遍历图，因为没有从那里开始的边。

再思考节点 `5`，只有一种方法可以从这里遍历图表: 我们只能到达节点 `6`。

对于节点 `3`，我们可以选择到 `5` 或者到 `6`，所以从 `3` 开始遍历图的方法的数量就是从 `5` 开始遍历图以及从 `6` 开始遍历图的方法的总和，例如：`1 + 1 = 2`。

我们一开始，有从“node”到“数值”的映射，数值表示遍历图的方法数量:

```text
node_6 = 1
node_5 = node_6 = 1
node_3 = node_5 + node_6 = 1 + 1 = 2
node_2 = node_3 + node_5 = 2 + 1 = 3
node_1 = node_2 + node_3 = 3 + 2 = 5
```

这听起来像是一些既便宜又不复杂的计算！请注意，我们的结果将略有不同，因为我们需要考虑额外的初始节点 `0` 和最终节点 `max + 3`，所以我们将以更多的路径结束:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut numbers: Vec<_> = std::iter::once(0)
        .chain(
            // this file contains 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
            include_str!("input2.txt")
                .lines()
                .map(|x| x.parse::<usize>().unwrap()),
        )
        .collect();
    numbers.sort_unstable();

    // numbers is still sorted after this
    numbers.push(numbers.iter().max().unwrap() + 3);

    let mut num_paths = HashMap::new();

    let n = numbers.len();
    num_paths.insert(numbers.last().copied().unwrap(), 1);
    for i in (0..(numbers.len() - 1)).into_iter().rev() {
        let i_val = numbers[i];
        let range = (i + 1)..=std::cmp::min(i + 3, n - 1);

        let num_neighbors: usize = range
            .filter_map(|j| {
                let j_val = numbers[j];
                let gap = j_val - i_val;
                if (1..=3).contains(&gap) {
                    Some(num_paths.get(&j_val).unwrap())
                } else {
                    None
                }
            })
            .sum();
        num_paths.insert(i_val, num_neighbors);
    }

    for &n in numbers.iter().rev() {
        let &m = num_paths.get(&n).unwrap();
        println!(
            "from {}, there's {} {}",
            n,
            m,
            if m == 1 { "path" } else { "paths" }
        );
    }
}
```

```shell
$ cargo run --quiet
from 9, there's 1 path
from 6, there's 1 path
from 5, there's 1 path
from 3, there's 2 paths
from 2, there's 3 paths
